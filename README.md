## Conclusions and Recommendations
- **Seasonal Trends:** The revenue peaks in specific months suggest that NorthWind Traders should adjust inventory and marketing strategies to capitalize on high-demand periods.
- **Focus on High-Margin Products:** Beverages and Dairy Products are driving significant revenue. However, products with lower profitability due to high freight costs (e.g., Meat & Poultry) should be carefully managed or optimized.
- **Freight Optimization:** Freight costs are reducing profit margins for several categories, especially Seafood and Condiments. NorthWind Traders should negotiate better shipping rates or explore local sourcing options to minimize these costs.
